			<b>Implementation and Validation of Vision–based Ground Target Geo–Localization for Miniature Aerial System, 7.5 months</b><br />
			<b>Technologies: </b><abbr title="(MAT)rix (LAB)oratory">MATLAB</abbr>, C#, Arduino, Embedded C++, VMWare<br />
			The project presented a computer vision based algorithm for accurate geo–localization of a ground target from an aerial image captured by the <abbr title="(M)iniature (A)erial (S)ystem">MAS</abbr>.<br />
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The user identifies and selects the ground target in the image taken by the camera on board <abbr title="(M)iniature (A)erial (V)ehicle">MAV</abbr>.</li>
			<li>Geographic co–ordinates of the ground target are then calculated using: MAV pose, Gimbal pose and Camera parameters.</li>
			<li>A method for generating synthetic aerial image for any given pose configuration of the MAV, the Gimbal and the Camera is implemented.</li>
			<li>Implemented on MATLAB and validated with a custom build of FlightGear Flight Simulator.</li>
