			<p class="w3-justify"><abbr title="Simple DirectMedia Library">SDL</abbr> is a cross-platform software library popularly used in multimedia applications and games development. I stumbled upon SDL while researching for a high-performance library to use in embedded software development. <abbr title="SDL Wrapper">SDLW</abbr> then started as a project that provides a thin wrapper around SDL along with support for error handling and is written in C/C++. SDLW is useful for basic image processing tasks and more. The download includes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>the static library</li>
				<li>the development header</li>
				<li>source code for few demo applications</li>
				<li>binaries for the demo applications</li>
			</ul>
