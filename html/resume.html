                <b>Environment: </b>MATLAB, C#<br />
                The thesis presented a computer vision based algorithm for accurate geo-localization of a ground target from an aerial image captured by the <abbr title="Miniature Aerial System">MAS</abbr>.<br />
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The user identifies and selects the ground target in the image taken by the camera on board <abbr title="Miniature Aerial Vehicle">MAV</abbr>.</li>
                <li>Geographic co-ordinates of the ground target are then calculated using: MAV pose, Gimbal pose and Camera parameters.</li>
                <li>A method for generating synthetic aerial image for any given pose configuration of the MAV, the Gimbal and the Camera is implemented.</li>
                <li>The method was implemented on MATLAB and tested with a custom build of FlightGear Flight Simulator.</li>
